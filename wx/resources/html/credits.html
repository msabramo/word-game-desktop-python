        <p>Inspired by Wordsmith on my TiVo® Series 3, written by <a
            href="http://www.carlhaynes.com/">Carl Haynes</a> whom I thank for
        an entertaining game and a thumbs up to the idea of releasing this
        software. Note that I took only inspiration from Wordsmith; not code,
        so please direct questions, bug reports, and comments about Word Up! to
        me rather than Carl.</p>

        <p>Word Up! uses tiles reminiscent of the tiles from <a
            href="http://www.scrabble.com/">SCRABBLE®</a>, but is otherwise
        different and is in no way affiliated with that game or its trademark
        holders.</p>

        <p>SCRABBLE® is a registered trademark. All intellectual property rights in and to
        the game are owned in the U.S.A and Canada by Hasbro Inc., and throughout the
