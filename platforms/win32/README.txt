Click letter tiles in the first row of the board to form words. Words must be
present in the built-in 178,691 word Tournament Word List and also must be at
least 3 letters long. 

You can use only the tiles in the first row of the board, but each time you
pull a tile, any tiles underneath it move up.

Click Apply to accept the currently formed word (only clickable when the formed
word is valid) and add the word's score (total point values of letters
multiplied by the length of the word) to your total score. The game will end
when there are no remaining words on the board.

Click Undo to remove the last tile added to the current word area and move it
back to where it came from.

Click Clear to remove all tiles in current word area and move them each back to
where they came from.
