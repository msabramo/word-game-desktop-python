        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        
        <p>Click letter tiles in the first row of the board to form words.
        Words must at least three letters long and present in the built-in 178,691-word <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_Word_List">Tournament
        Word List</a>.</p>
        
        <p>You can use only the tiles in the first row of the board.  Each time
        you use a tile, the tiles underneath it move up and the new top tile
        becomes available.</p>
        
        <p>Click <b>Apply</b> to accept the currently formed word and add the
        word score to your total score. This button is only clickable when
        the formed word is valid.</p>
        
        <p>Click <b>Undo</b> to remove the last tile added to the current
        word area and move it back to where it came from.</p>
        
        <p>Click <b>Clear</b> to remove all tiles in current word area and
        move them each back to where they came from.</p>

        <p>Click <b>New Game</b> or <b>Quit</b> when the dialog appears at the
        end of the game. The game ends automatically when the program detects
        that there are no words remaining on the board. You may also end the
        game yourself if you are stumped by clicking <b>New Game</b> or
        <b>Quit</b> in the <b>Game</b> menu. If you end the game and there are
        ten or less tiles remaining, a dialog will appear that shows you some of
        the possible words that were available on the board.</p>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>

        <p>The score for a word is calculated as the total point values of the
        letters multiplied by the length of the word. The score for a game is
        simply the sum of the scores for each word formed.</p>

        <h2>Top Scores</h2>

        <p>When the game ends, if your score is in the top ten, then you will
        be prompted to enter your name for the top score list.</p>

        <p>Click <b>View | Top Scores</b> to see the top scores. From the top
        scores window, you can view the game details for any of the top-scoring
        games. The game details include a list of all words played for that
        game. There is even a <b>Replay Game</b> button that lets you start a
        new game using the same board as the game in question.</p>
