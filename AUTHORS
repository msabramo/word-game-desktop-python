Word Up!

Written by Marc Abramowitz (http://marc-abramowitz.com/)

Inspired by Wordsmith on my TiVo® Series 3, written by Carl Haynes
(http://www.carlhaynes.com/), whom I thank for an entertaining game and a
thumbs up to the idea of releasing this software. Note that I took only
inspiration from Wordsmith; not code, so please direct questions, bug reports,
and comments about Word Up! to me rather than Carl.

Word Up! uses tiles reminiscent of the tiles from SCRABBLE®, but is otherwise
different and is in no way affiliated with that game or its trademark holders.
